## Backend (FastAPI)

The Python backend is built with FastAPI and provides:

- **Product API**: `/api/products` - Public product catalogue
- **Service API**: `/api/services` - Public service catalogue
- **Feedback API**: `/api/feedback/` - Submit and review customer feedback
- **Query API**: `/api/queries/` - Customer enquiry submissions
- **Analytics API**: `/api/analytics/` - Page visit tracking
- **Admin API**: `/api/admin/` - Authentication and management endpoints

### API Endpoints

| Endpoint | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| `/api/products` | Public product catalogue |
| `/api/services` | Public service catalogue |
| `/api/feedback` | Customer feedback submission and approved feedback |
| `/api/queries` | Customer enquiry submissions |
| `/api/analytics/visit` | Anonymous page-visit tracking |
| `/api/admin/login` | Admin authentication |
| `/api/admin/feedback` | Feedback review dashboard data |
| `/api/admin/queries` | Enquiry review data |
| `/api/admin/analytics` | Visitor analytics data |
| `/api/admin/products` | Add and manage products/services |
| `/api/admin/portfolio` | Add and manage projects |
| `/api/admin/offers` | Publish/delete expiring offer banners |

### Running the Backend

```bash
cd backend
pip install -r requirements.txt
uvicorn main:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8000
```

Production requires `DATABASE_URL`, `SECRET_KEY`, `ADMIN_USERNAME`,
`ADMIN_PASSWORD`, `APP_ENV=production`, `CORS_ORIGINS`, and `ALLOWED_HOSTS`.
Set `SEED_ON_STARTUP=true` to add any missing catalogue/content records during
backend startup. The seeder is idempotent and does not overwrite existing
admin-managed records. On backend startup, admin credentials are
read from `ADMIN_USERNAME` and `ADMIN_PASSWORD` and the admin account is
created or updated automatically. They are not stored in `config.json` or seed
data.

The optional backend keep-alive worker can be enabled with
`KEEP_ALIVE_ENABLED=true`, `KEEP_ALIVE_URL`, and
`KEEP_ALIVE_INTERVAL_MINUTES`. It is disabled by default for local development.

For PostgreSQL, the host, port, database name, and username can be kept in
`backend/config.json`; set only `DATABASE_PASSWORD` in `.env`. You can also
provide a complete `DATABASE_URL` instead. See `.env.example` for both forms.
If PostgreSQL is unavailable, the backend falls back to SQLite in
`backend/data/database.db` by default. Set `DATABASE_FALLBACK_TO_SQLITE=false`
to make PostgreSQL failure stop application startup instead.

## Frontend (React + Vite)

The React frontend is built with Vite and provides:

- **Homepage**: Hero section with products and services
- **Products**: Product catalogue with filtering and detail pages
- **Services**: Service catalogue with detail pages
- **Portfolio**: Project showcase
- **Testimonials**: Customer feedback display
- **Contact**: Contact form and information
- **Pages**: FAQs, Privacy Policy, Terms of Service, Warranty, Careers

### Frontend Development

```bash
cd frontend
npm install
npm run dev
```

### Building for Production

```bash
cd frontend
npm run build
```

The build output is placed in `frontend/dist/` and served by the backend or nginx.

## Deployment

### Native VPS deployment (Python + systemd + nginx)

Build the React app and copy the project to `/opt/kalyani-enterprises`:

```bash
cd /path/to/kalyani-enterprises
(cd frontend && npm ci && npm run build)
sudo mkdir -p /opt/kalyani-enterprises
sudo cp -r . /opt/kalyani-enterprises/
sudo useradd --system --home /opt/kalyani-enterprises --shell /usr/sbin/nologin kalyani
sudo -u kalyani python3 -m venv /opt/kalyani-enterprises/backend/.venv
sudo /opt/kalyani-enterprises/backend/.venv/bin/pip install -r /opt/kalyani-enterprises/backend/requirements.txt
sudo mkdir -p /opt/kalyani-enterprises/backend/data
sudo chown -R kalyani:kalyani /opt/kalyani-enterprises
```

Create `/opt/kalyani-enterprises/.env` with production secrets and host values,
then seed the database as the `kalyani` user:

```bash
sudo -u kalyani bash -lc 'cd /opt/kalyani-enterprises/backend && .venv/bin/python seed_data.py'
sudo cp deploy/kalyani-enterprises.service /etc/systemd/system/
sudo systemctl daemon-reload
sudo systemctl enable --now kalyani-enterprises
```

Install nginx, copy `deploy/nginx.conf` to
`/etc/nginx/sites-available/kalyani-enterprises`, enable it, then run
`sudo certbot --nginx` for HTTPS.

Docker remains available as an optional alternative through `Dockerfile`.
